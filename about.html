      <p class="p-j">
        The young violinist Silvan Irniger has won first prize in various regional and national competitions,
        including several Swiss Youth Music Competitions. He made his debut as a soloist with the Musica Antiqua Basel 
        chamber orchestra at the age of 13, followed by further solo appearances in the years that followed.
      </p>
      <p class="p-j">
        His artistic focus is on chamber music. He was a founding member of the successful Sereno Qartet,
        where he played as a violist for six years. Since 2020, he has been the principal violist of the
        Basel-based La Bosse Quartet, with which he attends the Stirng Quartet Undergraduate Course with
        Jiri Nemecek and Saiko Sasaki-Schmidt. He received further important chamber music impulses in master
        classes with the Amaryllis Quartet, the Diogenes Quartet, the Goldmund Quartet, as well as with Rainer
        Schmidt and Steven Isserlis.
      </p>
      <p class="p-j">
        Silvan Irniger also plays with great passion in numerous orchestras such as the Schleswig-Holstein
        Festival Orchestra, the Chamber Academy Basel, the Swiss Youth Symphony Orchestra and the Junge
        Zürcher Harmoniker.
      </p>
      <p class="p-j">
        At the age of 12, he was accepted into Emilie Haudenschild's talent development class at the
        Basel Music Academy. Budapest is an important stage in the young artist's life. In 2015/16,
        he attended the Szent István Music High School there as an exchange student, where he received violin
        lessons from György Lendvai and played as an academy player in the Zuglói Filharmónia Orchestra.
        After successfully completing his Bachelor's degree at the Basel University of Music in the class of Prof. Adelina Oprean, he began his Master's studies at the Zurich University of the Arts in the class of Prof. Andreas Janke in fall 2021.
